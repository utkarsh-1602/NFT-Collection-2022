Created my own NFT Collection, where users can mint the NFT's. There are only
20 NFT's and each of them is Unique. users should be able to mint 1 NFT with 1 Transaction. Whitelisted user's have 5 mins
presale time before the actual sale starts, where they are Guaranteed 1 NFT per Transaction. 


## ‚öôÔ∏è Working

* Used Oppenzeppelin framework to build secure smart contracts, using **ownable.sol** contract from openzeppelin which helps you to manage the ownership of the contract. **ownable.sol** let's you **transfer** and **renounce** ownership.  
* Built Smart contract using **hardhat**, used ERC721 extension known as **ERC721 enumerable**
* creating interface for whitelist contract (as we would not need to inherit and deploy the entire whitelist but only a part of it). 
* installed **dotenv** package to be able to import **.env** files and use it in our config 
* we will deploy our contract on Ethereum on **Goerli Network** using **QuickNode** (A lightning-fast global API provides instant access to Ethereum, Bitcoin & xDai networks.)
* Exporting *quicknode_http_url* and *private_key* in our **.env** file. 
* set up the goerli network on **hardhat.config.js** (so we can deploy our contract to goerli network) 
* Making website for my NFT Collection using **React.js** and **NEXT.js**
